# Morse-Discord-Bot
This is a Java-based bot for the popular messaging app Discord. The purpose of this bot is to gather information about a userâ€™s profile from the multiplayer game Valorant and display it over Discord. The focus of this project was to practice interacting with an API, web-scraping, and OOP concepts.
